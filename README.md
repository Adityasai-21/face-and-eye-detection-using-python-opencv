# face-and-eye-detection-using-python-opencv
I worked on a project to develop a face and eye detection system using Python and opencv. The project involved using Haar cascades to detect faces and eyes in real-time .Firstly, I collected a dataset of images with faces and eyes and trained a Haar cascade classifier using opencv. Then, I implemented the trained classifier in Python to detect faces and eyes in real-time video streams from a webcam. The output of the detection system was displayed on the screen inreal-time, with bounding boxes drawn around the detected faces and 
eyes
